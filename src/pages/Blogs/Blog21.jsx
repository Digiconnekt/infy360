                      <p>
                        Local SEO focuses on optimizing your online presence to
                        improve your business’s search visibility for specific,
                        nearby geographic areas. To improve the chances that
                        local customers looking for products or services you
                        offer will stumble upon you.

                          <p>
                            Over time, a listing for your business is created
                            and eventually duplicate listings accumulate. It’s
                            important to claim all listings under your business
                            name, remove any duplicates and ensure the remaining
                            listings’ information is accurate and up-to-date.
                            Finding all these listings may seem a bit daunting
                            but there are some great tools out there that make
                            the process very simple for anyone.
