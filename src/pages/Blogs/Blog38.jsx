                          Elon Musk is on a mission to protect our digital
                          privacy. He's worried that Apple's cozy relationship
                          with OpenAI could compromise user data security. Musk
                          envisions a "truth-seeking AI" that values
                          transparency and security – something he fears Apple
                          might overlook in its quest for market dominance.
