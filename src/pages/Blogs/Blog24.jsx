                        particular page or post is called an SEO slug, sometimes
                        referred to as a URL slug or permalink slug.

                      <p>
                        For instance, consider the URL
                        https://example.com/blog/the-impact-of-seo-slugs

                        search engines context about the page's content, which
                        facilitates understanding and helps the page rank
                        higher.
