                          SEO is the practice of optimizing your website to rank
                          higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) for
                          specific keywords and phrases. When your website
                          appears at the top of the search results, it drives
                          more traffic to your website, which can lead to more
                          leads, sales, and revenue.

                          SEO involves several strategies and techniques,

                          content, meta tags, and headers), off-page
                          optimization (building backlinks from high-quality
                          websites), and technical optimization (improving
