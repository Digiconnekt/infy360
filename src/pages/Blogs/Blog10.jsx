                        An essential component of digital communication
                        strategies for a long time is email marketing. It gives
                        businesses a direct channel of connection with
                        prospective clients, enabling them to send updates,
                        promotions, and messages right to the inboxes of their
                        intended audience. But just as the digital world has

                        queries or sending in the same updates to thousands of
