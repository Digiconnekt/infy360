                        in visitors and keep them on their platforms in the
                        ever-changing digital landscape. The bounce rate is a
                        crucial metric that indicates how well a website engages
                        visitors. A high bounce rate may indicate problems with

                        Let's first explore what bounce rate is and why it
                        matters before getting into the strategies. The
                        percentage of visitors to your website that departs
                        after only viewing one page and do not interact or
                        navigate to other pages is known as the "bounce rate." A
                        high bounce rate may be a sign that the content or user
                        experience on your website does not live up to user
                        expectations. Therefore it is necessary to plan the
                        website in a way that can retain the users.
