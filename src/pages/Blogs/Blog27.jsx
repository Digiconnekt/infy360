                        Currently, it is getting harder for businesses to catch
                        customers' interest with email marketing. People receive
                        many promotional emails every day - maybe even hundreds
                        or thousands in total. They all look very similar and
                        not specific. This leads to a large number of people
                        unsubscribing from these messages thereby reducing the
                        engagement of the business. Yet, making things more
                        personal could be what businesses need to improve their
                        results from email marketing efforts.

                        campaigns on a large scale. Doing more than just basic
                        Mail Merge tactics involves using strong customer data,
