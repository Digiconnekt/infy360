                      <h4>Understanding SEO and CRO</h4>
                      <p className="lead">
                        SEO is the practice of optimizing your website to rank
                        higher in search engine results pages (SERPs), thereby
                        increasing organic traffic. On the other hand, CRO
                        focuses on improving the percentage of website visitors
                        who take desired actions, such as making a purchase or
                        filling out a contact form.
                      </p>
                      <p className="lead">
                        While SEO brings traffic to your site, CRO ensures that
                        this traffic converts into tangible business results. By
                        combining these strategies, you can create a powerful
                        digital marketing machine that not only attracts
                        visitors but also turns them into customers.
                      </p>

                            Both SEO and CRO prioritize user experience. Search
                            engines favor websites that provide a good user
                            experience, while CRO focuses on making the user
                            journey as smooth as possible. By aligning these
                            goals, you can create a website that ranks well and
                            converts effectively.

                            High-quality, relevant content is crucial for both
                            SEO and CRO. SEO requires content that satisfies
                            user intent and includes relevant keywords. CRO
                            demands content that persuades users to take action.
                            By creating content that serves both purposes, you
                            can improve your search rankings and conversion
