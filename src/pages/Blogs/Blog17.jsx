                        It's crucial to comprehend the fundamentals of digital
                        paid media before learning how to optimize a campaign.
                        Any type of online advertising in which the advertiser
                        pays for their ad to be viewed by their target audience
                        is referred to as digital paid media. This can involve
                        display ads, social media ads, search engine ads, and
                        more. Increasing traffic leads, and sales for the
                        advertiser is the aim of digital paid media.

                        Businesses may additionally allocate a certain amount of
                        money to their campaigns and only pay when a user
                        completes a particular task, like clicking on an
                        advertisement or completing a purchase. But merely
                        putting up advertising and selecting your targeting
                        isn't going to ensure success. Businesses must maximise
                        their return on investment from digital paid media
                        initiatives.
