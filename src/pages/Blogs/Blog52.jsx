                        ROAS is calculated by dividing the revenue attributed to
                        ads by the cost of those ads. For example, if you spend
                        $1000 on ads and generate $5000 in revenue, your ROAS
                        would be 5:1 or 500%. This metric helps marketers and
                        businesses evaluate the efficiency of their ad campaigns
                        and make data-driven decisions to improve their
                        advertising strategies.
